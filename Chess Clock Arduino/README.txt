This should be everything you need to recreate a chess clock that I made for my school project in Year 11. 
Some of the sizes may have to be readjusted depending on your needs and preferences. Anyone needing this feel free to use this I give my full permission.
The 3d printing files have been left in .stl becuase google tells me it is the most widly used file format for 3d printing.
Also you might need to install the arduino IDE in order to transfer the code.

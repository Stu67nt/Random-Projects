These are just random projects I have made. Don't expect them to be good I just want to doccument progress I have made so far and hopefully future progress!

Any prerequisites required for the programs to work will be mentioned below: 

    ALL PROGRAMS REQUIRE INSTALLATION OF PYTHON
    
    WordleLetterCount.py: 
    Requires wordledic.txt to function.

    VotingSystem.py:
    Requires voterID.py to function but you can also add voterIDgen.py if you want.

    Chess.py:
    Requires installation of chess module using "pip install chess" .
    

Any programs which require other files have been sorted into folders. Individual programs which dont require other files are not in folders.

If your seeing this hope you have a nice day. o/

These are just random projects I have made. Don't expect them to be good i just want to doccument progress I have made so far and hopefully future progress!

Any prerequisites required for the programs to work will be mentioned below: 

    WordleLetterCount.py: 
    Requires wordledic.txt to function.

    VotingSystem.py:
    Requires voterID.py to function but you can also add voterIDgen.py if you want.

Any programs which require other files have been sorted into folders. Individual programs which dont require other files are not in folders.

If your seeing this hope you have a nice day. o/

	Hello, you are going to have to manually install the python module keyboard for this to work.
	
 	To do this you use the command 'pip install keyboard' in command prompt. 
	If you do not have pip installed you will have to do that.
	NOTE: First do the 'pip install keyboard' command in command prompt if you have python installed as you may alr have it installed when you got python.
	Once you have the latest version of python running as well as pip and have installed the module 'keyboard'.
	If you have a program where you can edit and run programs you can run it from there. 
	If not get one like PyCharm Community Edition.

 	Reach out if you need more help.
